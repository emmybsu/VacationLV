# VacationLV

This project is fueled by Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.  The files inside of Resources were too large to add to GitHub.  These files will be loaded to our database at a later date to be viewable in this team repository.

For now, this repository will be used to store the Pandas script.  The files used are from Datafiniti (2), lasvegas tripadvisor (1), and one other source.
